BMI Factor Calculator


For this assignment, you will build a BMI calculator.

This program should be build using both procedural and object-oriented programming.

You should have a Class that holds the data and a method that calculates the BMI

The BMI calculator will take the following input from the user:

1. Weight in pounds

2. Height in inches

You will convert these inputs to the metrics system, which means you will convert the weight to kg and the height to meters.

After the conversion is made, you will calculate the user's BMI by using the following formula

bmi = weight/(height*height)

The program will calculate the user's BMI and display a message depending on the BMI of the user:

 

 If the user's BMI is less or equal to 18.5, display a message on the console telling the user the value of their BMI, and that he/she is underweight 
If the user's BMI is greater than 18.5 and smaller than 25, display a message on the console telling the user the value of their BMI, and that he/she is normal
 If the user's BMI is equal to or greater than 25, display a message on the console telling the user the value of their BMI, and that he/she is overweight.
You should have comme
